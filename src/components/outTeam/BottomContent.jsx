          Dissertation by Design does not discriminate on the basis of race,
          color, religion, sex, national origin, political affiliation, sexual
          orientation, gender identity, marital status, disability, and genetic
          information, or age. Dissertation by Design strives to be a safe space
          for anyone who belongs to a historically marginalized group. We
          welcome all clients from these groups as we are aware that academic
          spaces have not traditionally served people of color and people whose
          gender identities and/or sexual orientation are not heteronormative.
          We will do our best to create spaces where clients neither need to
          hide nor share these important aspects of their identities.
